**Charla** is a terminal based application for chatting with language models. Charla integrates with Ollama and GitHub Models for exchanging messages with model services.

## Features

* Terminal-based chat system that supports context aware conversations with language models.
* Support for local models via Ollama and remote models via GitHub Models.
* Chat sessions are saved as markdown files in the user's documents directory when ending a chat.
* Prompt history is saved and previously entered prompts are auto-suggested.
* Switch between single-line and multi-line input modes without interrupting the chat session.
* Store user preferences in user config or current directory settings files.
* Provide a system prompt for a chat session.
* Load content from local files and web pages to append to prompts.

## Installation

To use Charla with models on your computer, you need a running installation of the [Ollama server](https://ollama.com/download) and at least one supported language model must be installed. For [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) you need access to the service and a GitHub token. Please refer to the documentation of the service provider you want to use for installation and setup instructions.

Install Charla using `pipx`:

```console
pipx install charla
```

For GitHub models, set the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN to your token. In Bash enter:

```console
export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

## Usage

After successful installation and setup you can launch the chat console with the `charla` command in your terminal.

If you use Charla with Ollama, the default provider, you only need to specify the model to use, e.g.:

```console
charla -m phi3
```

If you want to use GitHub Models, you have to set the provider:

```console
charla -m gpt-4o --provider github
```

You can set a default model and change the default provider in your user settings file.

## Settings

Settings can be specified as command line arguments and in the settings files. Command line arguments have the highest priority. The location of your user config settings file depends on your operating system. Use the following command to show the location:

```console
charla settings --location
```

You can also store settings in the current working directory in a file named `.charla.json`. The settings in this local override the user config settings.

Example settings for using OpenAI's GPT-4o model and the GitHub Models service by default.

```json
{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "chats_path": "./chats",
    "prompt_history": "./prompt-history.txt",
    "provider": "github",
    "message_limit": 20,
    "multiline": false
}
```
